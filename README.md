This code uses the getElementsByTagName method to get all table elements on the page, then loops through each table and extracts the data from each row and cell using similar methods. The innerText property is used to extract the contents of each cell. You can modify this code to suit your specific needs, such as filtering the data or storing it in an array or object.
